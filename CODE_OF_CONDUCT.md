# Adafruit Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and leaders pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level or type of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Be kind and courteous to others
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Collaborating with other community members
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
* The use of inappropriate images, including in a community member's avatar
* The use of inappropriate language, including in a community member's nickname
* Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
* Excessive or unwelcome helping; answering outside the scope of the question
  asked
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Promoting or spreading disinformation, lies, or conspiracy theories against
  a person, group, organisation, project, or community
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

The goal of the standards and moderation guidelines outlined here is to build
and maintain a respectful community. Around the world, participants in this
community are learning, making, and creating. We are committed to providing a
friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level or type of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct and the enforcement policies listed above apply to all
Adafruit Community venues. This includes but is not limited to any community
spaces (both public and private), the entire Adafruit Discord server, and
Adafruit GitHub repositories. Examples of Adafruit Community spaces include
but are not limited to meet-ups, audio chats on the Adafruit Discord, or
interaction at a conference.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. As a community
we will always work to welcome new people, listen to their needs, and work with
them to grow an even more inclusive community.

## Contact Information

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing support@adafruit.com. Please include your name and a description
